# MathematicaLieFunctions
Package developed originally during the developement of the PhD. Thesis "Quadratic Lie algebras. Algorithms and (de)constructions" as a support tool.

After downloading the package, in order to use it, you need to install and, after that, import it in every Mathematica Notebook in which you make use of it. The installation can be done through the menu of the application: File $\blacktriangleright$ Install. Once installed, before using it, you need to import it writing `` <<LieFunctions` `` or whatever new name you have chosen.

If you do not have access to an installation of Mathematica, you can use it online at its webpage [https://www.wolframcloud.com](https://www.wolframcloud.com). Here, with a free account, you can still import the package and call every function. However, there is a limit about the computation time available to used in that free mode. This is why the most demanding functions can present problems. Anyway, to install the package, as there is no File menu, the alternative is executing the command:
```
PacletInstall["https://github.com/joroldan/MathematicaLieFunctions/releases/download/v1.1/LieFunctions.paclet"]
```
changing the final part `1.0.0` for whatever version we are interested in. This same command also works in the offline version. The rest works exactly the same.

A guide about how you can use the included fuctions is available in the original dissertation (Chapter 6) and it is aimed to be included in the package itself.
